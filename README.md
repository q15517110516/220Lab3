# CISC220 Lab3
For this lab, download the skeleton code and fill in the missing functions marked with a
“//CODE HERE” comment. Do not alter the function names or the tests will not compile
(but you can add functions of your own!). Reminder: code that does not compile will not
be graded – it is better to turn in commented function logic than code that does not
compile. There are many tests in main.cpp, but the function call is commented to avoid
errors when running.
Reminder: this lab is individual or in pairs only. If submitting with a partner, only submit
one zip file and be sure that both partners’ names are in the README.

## What I want you to learn:
* How AVL trees are implemented
* How AVL rotations work
* How traversals are done on trees
* More practice with template classes and asserts for testing
## Problem
In this lab, you will be implementing AVL trees. The point is just to fully implement an
AVL tree that accepts a Data class as its type (it is a template class). The Data class
DoubleData defines a method to compare to other DoubleData objects, which you
should use when comparing those objects. AVLTree is a template class, so all the code is
going in the header file again.

We have provided many tests in the main function, but you can add tests if you are
unsure of any functionality (try to find some untested cases). Writing test cases is very
useful when writing any kind of code, and the easiest way to show that your code
works.
